As a JavaScript developer starting a simple calculator project like the one provided, here’s what you should focus on before beginning, with clear and simple requirements tailored to user needs:

1. **Understand User Needs**:
   - **Example**: The user wants a calculator with a display, digit buttons (0-9), operators (+, -, ×, ÷), equals, and clear buttons.
   - **Focus**: Clarify if the user needs additional features (e.g., decimal support, backspace, or memory functions) or specific UI preferences (e.g., layout, colors).

2. **Plan the UI Structure (HTML)**:
   - **Requirement**: Create a simple HTML layout with a display area (`<div>` or `<input>`) and buttons for digits, operators, equals, and clear.
   - **Focus**: Ensure the UI is intuitive, with clear labels and organized button placement (e.g., grid layout for numbers).

3. **Define Core Functionality (JavaScript)**:
   - **Requirement**: Handle user input to build expressions (e.g., "5+3"), perform calculations, and display results.
   - **Focus**: Plan functions for arithmetic operations, input parsing (splitting "5+3" into `num1`, `operator`, `num2`), and error handling (e.g., division by zero).

4. **Event Handling**:
   - **Requirement**: Capture button clicks to update the display and trigger calculations.
   - **Focus**: Use event listeners to append digits/operators to the display and compute results when the equals button is clicked.

5. **Error Handling**:
   - **Requirement**: Prevent errors like missing numbers or invalid operations (e.g., "5+" or "10/0").
   - **Focus**: Validate inputs before calculating and show user-friendly error messages (e.g., "Need 2nd Num").

6. **Basic Styling (CSS)**:
   - **Requirement**: Make the calculator visually clear and responsive.
   - **Focus**: Ensure buttons are clickable, the display is readable, and the layout works on different screen sizes.

7. **Testing and Debugging**:
   - **Requirement**: Ensure the calculator works for all basic operations and edge cases.
   - **Focus**: Test scenarios like consecutive operations (e.g., "5+3+2"), clearing the display, and handling invalid inputs.

**Example Workflow**:
- **User Scenario**: User clicks "5", "+", "3", then "=". The display should show "8.00".
- **Focus**: Ensure the code captures "5+3", splits it correctly, performs addition, and formats the result.

**Simple Requirements Checklist**:
- HTML: Display and buttons for digits (0-9), operators (+, -, ×, ÷), equals, clear.
- CSS: Clean, responsive design with visible buttons and display.
- JavaScript: Functions for arithmetic, input handling, error checking, and result display.
- User Experience: Intuitive flow, clear feedback (e.g., error messages), and reset functionality.

By focusing on these areas, you align the project with user expectations and ensure a functional, user-friendly calculator.
